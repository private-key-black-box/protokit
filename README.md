üéÆ Navigating the complexities of private keys and digital signatures can be daunting for average users, and errors can result in loss of funds. To address this, we propose a wallet solution built on Mina, leveraging Protokit, which eliminates the need for complex seed phrase management and simplifies digital signatures.

This approach reduces the likelihood of errors and facilitates easier integration with legacy systems, ensuring a smoother transition without significant changes to infrastructure and processes.

‚öôÔ∏è Built on o1js, Protokit, Rust, Typescript and React.

### Mina - Build a zkAppChain using Protokit Framework

Our project is build completely with the Protokit framework. We created a zkAppChain that aims to improve UX, by replacing signing transactions to proof ownership by ZKP's using 01js.
